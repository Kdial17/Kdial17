## Khadija Dial

I'm a senior at the University of Washington, studying Informatics with a specialization in Data Science and Human-Computer Interaction! My passion lies at the intersection of data and design where I bridge these disciplines to craftmeaningful and intuitive user experiences that empower, unite, and bring joy to communities. Let's create something cool together!
